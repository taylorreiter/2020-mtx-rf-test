This repository test whether random forests classifier built using metagenome
data is accurate on metatranscriptome data. The random forests classifier was
built in github.com/dib-lab/2020-ibd. The metatranscriptome data was
preprocessed and signatures were calculated at github.com/taylorreiter/cosmo-kmers.
These files were imported into this workflow instead of regenerating them.
I may eventually merge this workflow wtih github.com/dib-lab/2020-ibd.
